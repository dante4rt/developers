# Code of Conduct

1. Make sure you are aligned with our Core Values.
1. Ensure the quality of your work. It is a sign of poor ownership and lack of
   confidence when you expect someone to deal with your incomplete work.
1. Assign yourself to the Problem you are solving so others are aware of it.
1. Use `@mention` only when the person truly needs to be notified or take action
   — otherwise, use reactions (likes, thumbs up, etc.) for acknowledgment.
1. Leave daily updates on relevant tasks/problems to maintain visibility and
   simplicity for the team.
1. Keep all communication task-focused: work topics, deliverables, questions,
   status, decisions, outcomes only. No personal compliments/flattery, unrelated
   hesitation/fear, or extra personal remarks.

## Core Values

- **“Dream Big”** — it's important to set ambitious goals to challenge the
  status quo. Otherwise, it's not worth it.
- **“Do the Right Thing”** — if you do something “right” but it is the wrong
  thing to do, your efforts will be in vain.
- **“Keep it Simple”** — simplicity is a significant key to success. The most
  complicated skill is to be simple.  
  _In communication, this means keeping messages concise, clear, and
  work-centered. We value straightforward updates, feedback, and reactions over
  unnecessary elaboration or personal asides that can complicate understanding
  or slow progress._
- **“Own it with Passion”** — we believe in taking ownership and responsibility
  for our work. We encourage a mindset of accelerated learning as you “figure it
  out yourself” and the drive to go beyond expectations. We are passionate about
  what we do and understand that our team success is dependent on us.
- **“Be Open”** — expand your horizons by challenging your beliefs and embracing
  new knowledge, ideas, and opportunities. See things from the perspective of
  others, and you may uncover potential missteps and grow in your understanding.
  Open your mind to learn and grow, strengthening your self-belief. It's not
  failure that matters, but the ability to get back up after falling.
- **“Keep the Focus”** — to achieve our team goals, ask, “What is our biggest
  obstacle?” and focus on the next actionable step. Continuously review our
  goals to ensure that your actions are aligned. Identify areas of improvement
  constantly to streamline resources and enhance business efficacy.
